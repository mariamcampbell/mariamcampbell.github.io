I am a final-year PhD candidate in Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cape Town. My research focuses on extended models of general relativity, particularly their applications to early universe cosmology and stellar interiors. I am especially interested in testing and constraining these models using current observational data, including phenomena such as neutron stars, magnetars, and black holes, as well as astrophysical signatures like gravitational waves and gravitational lensing.

I am passionate about understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe, and I enjoy bridging the gap between theory and observation. Outside of research, Iâ€™m also interested in science communication, data visualization, and arts & craft.
